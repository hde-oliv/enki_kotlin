</div>

## Constructed with:
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/)
- [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed)
- [PGJDBC-NG](https://impossibl.github.io/pgjdbc-ng/)
- Love, of course.

## Brief Introduction:

This is a simple clone of my other [REST API](https://github.com/hde-oliv/enki) made in C, constructed to gain more understanding about Kotlin in general.

##  Todo:
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] containerization
- [ ] how to host it
